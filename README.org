# score-generator

A Clojure library designed to build a simple DSL to generate MusicXML. This is
just a quick and dirty way to take lead sheets I have, turn them into MusicXML,
and import them into Guitar Pro 7 for final cleanup.

This code is currently in the =rush it out and see if it works= stage. There are
some tests but there are also some choices I made that I wouldn't have
ordinarily.

It may or may not be worth cleaning up depending on how my explorations with Lilypond go...

## Usage

Currently loading up a repl and calling ~(generate-musicxml infile outfile)~ produces
an outfile in MusicXML.

If for some reason someone is nuts enough to look at this as is, start with generate-musicxml and this parser definition:

#+begin_src clojure
(def simple-score
  (insta/parser
   " key    = <'Key: '> step [acc]
    acc    = 'b' | '#'
    <timesig> = <'Time Signature: '> beats <'/'> type
    beats   = bnum
    type    = tnum
    <bnum>  = '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8'
    <tnum>  = '1'|'2'|'4'|'8'
    measure    = notes
    <notes>      = note | (note <' '> notes)
    space      = <' '>
    note       = pitch <'/'> duration | rest
    rest       = <'r'> duration
    pitch      = step octave [<','>alter]
    duration   = ('1' | '2' | '4' | '8' | '12' | '16') [dotted]
    dotted     = <'.'>
    alter      = ('+'|'-')('1'|'2')
    step       = 'a' | 'b' | 'c' | 'd' | 'e' | 'f' | 'g' | 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D' | 'E' | 'F' | 'G'
    octave     = '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8'"))
#+end_src

In order to accelerate things I use instaparse's ability to provide a start rule and enforced a string file structure:

#+begin_src bash
<song title>
Key: <song key>
Time Signature: <beats>/<beat-type>
measures
#+end_src

The measures section is one measure per line. There is an example file in resources.
